			/** This script checks users in and out of robotics and logs their hours to Firebase.
			  * Then an analysis on their hours is ran, and their ability to complete their
			  * hour commitment is assessed.
			  *
			  *	This program must run with the proper Firebase database configuration. Users must be entered in database
			  * before running program, or every ID will be rejected.
			  *
			  * This program was designed for a team that uses a tier system of hour commitment. For example,
			  * members in tier 1 would need to complete more hours than members in tier 3, the lowest tier.
			  *
			  * This program uses javascript promises.
			  * The Firebase API has synchronus calls, so while the browser fetches data from firebase, 
			  * the script is still running. The problem with this is that data may be requested, but
			  * be returned AFTER it was supposed to be used by a following function. To fix this, 
			  * promises are used to execute code block by block, and suspend execution until a task finishes.
			  *
			  * This program was designed to run on Chrome and is only verified to work properly on Chrome. At the
			  * time of creation, this program does not run properly on Internet Explorer.
